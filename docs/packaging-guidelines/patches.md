# Patches

This document describes openRuyi's patch policy.

## General Policy

A comment line should precede every patch that a spec file references. This comment may briefly describe the purpose of the patch, or provide a link to the corresponding upstream discussion or source.

## Patch File Naming Policy

All patch files should begin with a four-digit numeric prefix. openRuyi reserves different numeric ranges for different types of patches:

* Use the range `0001-0999` for patches you take from upstream for the same version.

* Use the range `1000-1999` for CVE fixes and backported patches from other upstream versions.

* Use the range `2000-2999` for openRuyi-specific patches that do not target upstream acceptance.

## Using Individual `Patch` Tags

Place `Patch` tags above the `BuildOption` tag (if present), or above the `BuildRequires` tag.

```specfile
# https://github.com/pypa/wheel/pull/655
Patch0:         0001-adjusts-tests-for-setuptools-78.patch
```

If you prefer, you may also include an explanatory comment together with the link:

```specfile
# Upstream has removed this code entirely instead
# https://github.com/pypa/wheel/pull/655
Patch0:         0001-adjusts-tests-for-setuptools-78.patch
```

## Using `%patchlist`

openRuyi does not recommend using individual `Patch` tags if a package contains more than three patches. In such cases, use `%patchlist` instead.

When using `%patchlist`, you must place the patch list above `%description`. See [this discussion](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/752) for details.

```specfile
%patchlist
# Fix executable space protection patch, upstream plans to do this
0001-unzip-6.0-exec-shield.patch
# http://www.info-zip.org/board/board.pl?m-1259575993/
0002-unzip-6.0-attribs-overflow.patch
# ...
# covscan issues
0020-unzip-6.0-COVSCAN-fix-unterminated-string.patch
```

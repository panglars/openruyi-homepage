# How to install openRuyi Server

This article explains how to install and use the openRuyi Server Edition. The openRuyi Server Edition provides a standard operating system environment for physical servers, virtual machines, and edge computing nodes.

## Before You Begin

You will first need to obtain the openRuyi image files and the corresponding checksum files.
Please visit our news site and refer to the latest release article, where you can find the ISO image and the checksums for the installation media.

## Verify Image Integrity

We provide SHA256 checksums for all image files. You may use any tool that supports the SHA256 algorithm to verify the integrity of the downloaded files.

If the sha256sum command is available on your current system, place the checksum file in the same directory as the installation image and run the following command:

```bash
$ sha256sum openruyi-xxxx.xx-Server-dvd.iso
```

## Installation Requirements

Before starting the installation, please note the following:

* Prepare either a DVD or a USB flash drive to write the ISO installation image.

  * If you are installing on SG2044, you may instead prepare an NVMe SSD for the ISO installation image. Additionally, you will need an SD card for the [EDK2 firmware](https://github.com/revyos/firmware-sg204x/releases/download/20260212/firmware_edk2-sg2044-single-revyos_6.18.y-sg204x-v1.8.1-rva23.img).

* Prepare another drive as the target disk for the openRuyi system.

:::warning Warning

All data on the target disk will be overwritten. Please back up any important data in advance.

## Boot from the Installation Media

To start the installation process, insert the DVD into the optical drive, or connect the USB flash drive or other installation media, and then power on the machine.

* If you are installing on SG2044, simply install the NVMe SSD containing the installation image together with the SD card.

## Install the System
